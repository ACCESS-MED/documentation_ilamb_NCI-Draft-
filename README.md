# ACCESS-NRI support for ILAMB at NCI

[![Docs Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ilamb-workflow/badge/?version=latest)](https://ilamb-workflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/608906925.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14183928)

This repository is used to maintain the [International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB)](https://www.ilamb.org) and International Ocean Model Benchmarking (IOMB) model evaluation tools on NCI infrastracture.

The documentation provided [here](https://ilamb-workflow.readthedocs.io/) is designed to supplement, rather than replace, the official [ILAMB documentation](https://www.ilamb.org/doc/). This documentation is tailored to using the tool within the NCI infrastructure. We encourage users to read the ILAMB documentation and to
try on the [ILAMB Tutorial](https://www.ilamb.org/doc/tutorial.html).

ILAMB development is primarily performed by the [RUBISCO](https://www.bgc-feedbacks.org/) Science Focus Area and supported by the [RGMA](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/program-area/regional-global-model-analysis) Activity of the [EESSD](https://science.osti.gov/ber/Research/eessd) division of the [BER](https://science.osti.gov/ber) program in the United States Department of Energy's Office of Science.

## What is ILAMB? 

The International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) project is a model-data intercomparison and integration project designed to improve the performance of land models and, in parallel, improve the design of new measurement campaigns to reduce uncertainties associated with key land surface processes. 

## What are we releasing? 

ACCESS-NRI is releasing an NCI configuration of ILAMB under the name ILAMB-workflow.  

ILAMB-workflow is the ACCESS-NRI software and data infrastructure that enables the ILAMB evaluation framework on NCI Gadi. It includes the ILAMB Python packages, a series of ILAMB output for ACCESS model evaluation and the ILAMB-Data collection of observational datasets. ILAMB-workflow is configured to use the existing NCI supported CMIP data collections.

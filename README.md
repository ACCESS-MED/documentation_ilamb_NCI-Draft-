# ACCESS-NRI support for ILAMB at NCI

[![Docs Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ilamb-workflow/badge/?version=latest)](https://ilamb-workflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This repository is used to maintain the [International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB)](https://www.ilamb.org) and International Ocean Model Benchmarking (IOMB) model evaluation tools on NCI infrastracture.

The documentation provided [here](https://ilamb-workflow.readthedocs.io/) is designed to supplement, rather than replace, the official [ILAMB documentation](https://www.ilamb.org/doc/). This documentation is tailored to using the tool within the NCI infrastructure. We encourage users to read the ILAMB documentation and to
try on the [ILAMB Tutorial](https://www.ilamb.org/doc/tutorial.html).

ILAMB development is primarily performed by the [RUBISCO](https://www.bgc-feedbacks.org/) Science Focus Area and supported by the [RGMA](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/program-area/regional-global-model-analysis) Activity of the [EESSD](https://science.osti.gov/ber/Research/eessd) division of the [BER](https://science.osti.gov/ber) program in the United States Department of Energy's Office of Science.
